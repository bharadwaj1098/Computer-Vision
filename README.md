DATA :- https://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-100.php

CONTENT :- There are 7,200 images of 100 objects. Each object was turned on a turnable through 360 degrees to vary object pose with respect to a fixed color camera. Images of the objects were taken at pose intervals of 5 degrees. This corresponds to 72 poses per object. There images were then size normalized. Objects have a wide variety of complex geometric and reflectance characteristics.
